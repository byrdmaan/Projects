              <p>A group of research students and I were asked to use design research to increase student ridership on the Dallas Area Rapid Transport, or DART.  We started our research with our own experiences and fly on the wall experiences, which led into storyboarding the experience and light interviews with other students.</p>

              <p id="indent"><b>Using our research, we did group synthesis that led us to two distinct paths:</b><br><br>


              1) First, that the general student population didn’t know where the DART could take them.<br>2)That students had deep frustrations with getting to the DART stations.</p>

              

              <p>Using these findings, we broke off into a few groups; my group’s goal was to increase students love and knowledge of Dallas.  With that starting point, our team made a first iteration of a map of the Dart that was engaging and changeable by the students.  There were some successes and failures with that, and after some interviews of students who engaged with it, we found that people didn't feel engaged enough on a college campus where there is already maps and posters everywhere.  We then moved to a second prototype, that was set up in a widely traveled zone with no other objects around, and let people add to and extrapolate other people’s ideas using post it notes.</p>
